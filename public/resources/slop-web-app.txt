Please create a new app "Create a Slop" to generate AI images with the LetzAI API, based on user inputs with radio-buttons and short text input fields. The LetzAI API specifications are uploaded to the knowledge base. The frontend web-page has the following elements :

1. A title that I can modify easely in Github.

2. A description that I can modify easely in Github.

3. An accordion labeled "Introduction", closed at start, including a text that I can modify easily in Github.

4. A series of 7 radio buttons with the following labels :
* Large family
* Birthday
* Sculpture
* Fruits & Vegetables
* Animals
* Food
* Archeology

5. A series of 3 short text input fields (max 20 characters) with labels that change depending on the radio buttons selected in feature 4. The 3 labels are as follows, in the same order as the labels of feature 4 :
* Number of children (integer), Parents (mother, father, both, grand-parents), Location (home, outside)
* Age (integer), Person (man, woman, boy, girl), Environment (alone, in hospital, with family, with friends)
* Sculptor (man, woman, boy, girl), Material (wood. plastic, waste, vegetables), location (home, wood, Africa)
* Cultivation (fruits, vegetables, quantities), Abnormality (small, big, likeness), Persons (family, man, woman, children, market, field)
* Animal (birds, mammals, pets, fishes), Action (cub transport, feed), Location (nest, lair, water)
* Food (pastries, meal),  Abnormality (quantity, look, size), Cook (man, woman, child, animal)

Set up the labels that I can modify them easily in Github.

6. Select a preconfigured prompt depending on the radio buttons selected in feature 4. Replace placeholders in the prompt for the labels of feature 5 with the inputs of the 3 text inputs.

7. An accordion labeled "Introduction", closed at start, to display the generated prompt.
  
8. A LetzAI API KEY field to enter te secret key by the user, with a save and clear button.

9. A Start button to launch the image generation, coupled with a Stop/Clear button to clear all radio buttons, text input fields, prompt field and the generated LetzAI image. The LetzAI image will be generated with the following parameters :

* quality: 3,
* creativity: 4,
* hasWatermark: true,
* systemVersion: 3,
* mode: "turbo"

10. An image placeholder showing an image example that I can upload in Github. This image will be replaced by the generated LetzAI image.

11. An accordion labeled "Slop Examples", including a gallery to display slop images with text descriptions beneath each image. Please do the set-up of the gallery to allow me to upload the images with the related text in Github.
